Update your ReviewController as follows:

@review = Review.new(review_params)
@review.user_id = current_user_id
end
Also add this to your controller just below the first before_action:
before_action :authenticate_user


 go to rails console by typing
 rails console
 find the first review or a review by id
 like:
 @review = Review.first
 then associate it to a user_id

 go to show.html.erb for review_params view
